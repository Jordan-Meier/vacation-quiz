#Vacation Destination quiz

##Epicodus Week 2 code review

###By: Jordan Meier

###Description:
This week's code review project is a webpage that suggests a vacation destination after a user answers several questions about themselves. It should show familiarity with jQuery, JavaScript as well as HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

###Known Bugs
* Accurate media queries needed to refit the quiz form on sm and xs screen sizes. The form starts to wrap on itself on smaller screens, making it impossible to take the quiz on a mobile device.
